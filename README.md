# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
Wine Quality Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression is a data analysis project that aims to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical composition.Regression analysis helps quantify the relationship between these chemical properties and wine quality, allowing us to predict the quality based on different input parameters. The project involves using a dataset that contains various physicochemical properties of wine, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, sulphates, alcohol, and pH, along with the corresponding quality scores.

Steps Involved in the Project:

Data Collection: Gathering the dataset, either from publicly available wine quality databases or through laboratory experiments.

Data Cleaning: Processing the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
Handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing variables if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Identifying trends and relationships between different wine attributes and quality scores.
Visualizing data using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand variable significance.

Feature Engineering:Transforming and selecting key features to improve model performance.
Creating interaction terms and scaling variables as needed.

Model Selection:Choosing Multiple Linear Regression to model the relationship between wine attributes and quality.

Model Training: Fitting the regression model using techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Gradient Descent to minimize errors.

Model Evaluation:Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as:
R-squared (R²) – Explains how well the model fits the data.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted quality scores.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – Evaluates model accuracy.

Model Deployment: Using the trained model to predict wine quality based on new chemical composition data.
Deploying the model in a real-world application, such as a wine quality assessment tool.

Conclusion: This project provides valuable insights into how different physicochemical properties influence wine quality.
